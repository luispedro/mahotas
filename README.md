# Mahotas

## Python Computer Vision Library

Mahotas is a library of fast computer vision algorithms (all implemented
in C++ for speed) operating over numpy arrays.

Python versions 2.7, 3.3+, are supported.

Notable algorithms:

- [watershed](http://mahotas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distance.html)
- [convex points calculations](http://mahotas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/polygon.html).
- hit & miss, thinning.
- Zernike & Haralick, LBP, and TAS features.
- [Speeded-Up Robust Features
  (SURF)](http://mahotas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/surf.html), a form of local
  features.
- [thresholding](http://mahotas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/thresholding.html).
- convolution.
- Sobel edge detection.
- spline interpolation
- SLIC super pixels.

Mahotas currently has over 100 functions for image processing and
computer vision and it keeps growing.

The release schedule is roughly one release a month and each release
brings new functionality and improved performance. The interface is very
stable, though, and code written using a version of mahotas from years
back will work just fine in the current version, except it will be
faster (some interfaces are deprecated and will be removed after a few
years, but in the meanwhile, you only get a warning). In a few
unfortunate cases, there was a bug in the old code and your results will
change for the better.

details below under [Citation](#Citation)) if you use it in a publication.

## Examples

This is a simple example (using an example file that is shipped with
mahotas) of calling watershed using above threshold regions as a seed
(we use Otsu to define threshold).

    # import using ``mh`` abbreviation which is common:
    import mahotas as mh

    # Load one of the demo images
    im = mh.demos.load('nuclear')

    # Automatically compute a threshold
    T_otsu = mh.thresholding.otsu(im)

    # Label the thresholded image (thresholding is done with numpy operations
    seeds,nr_regions = mh.label(im > T_otsu)

    # Call seeded watershed to expand the threshold
    labeled = mh.cwatershed(im.max() - im, seeds)

Here is a very simple example of using `mahotas.distance` (which
computes a distance map):

    import pylab as p
    import numpy as np
    import mahotas as mh

    f = np.ones((256,256), bool)
    f[200:,240:] = False
    f[128:144,32:48] = False
    # f is basically True with the exception of two islands: one in the lower-right
    # corner, another, middle-left

    dmap = mh.distance(f)
    p.imshow(dmap)
    p.show()

(This is under [mahotas/demos/distance.py](https://github.com/luispedro/mahotas/blob/master/mahotas/demos/distance.py).)

How to invoke thresholding functions:

    import mahotas as mh
    import numpy as np
    from pylab import imshow, gray, show, subplot
    from os import path

    # Load photo of mahotas' author in greyscale
    photo = mh.demos.load('luispedro', as_grey=True)

    # Convert to integer values (using numpy operations)
    photo = photo.astype(np.uint8)

    # Compute Otsu threshold
    T_otsu = mh.otsu(photo)
    thresholded_otsu = (photo > T_otsu)

    # Compute Riddler-Calvard threshold
    T_rc = mh.rc(photo)
    thresholded_rc = (photo > T_rc)

    # Now call pylab functions to display the image
    gray()
    subplot(2,1,1)
    imshow(thresholded_otsu)
    subplot(2,1,2)
    imshow(thresholded_rc)
    show()

As you can see, we rely on numpy/matplotlib for many operations.

## Install

If you are using [conda](http://anaconda.org/), you can install mahotas from
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/) using the following commands:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install mahotas

### Compilation from source

You will need python (naturally), numpy, and a C++ compiler. Then you
should be able to use:

    pip install mahotas

You can test your installation by running:

    python -c "import mahotas as mh; mh.test()"

If you run into issues, the manual has more [extensive documentation on
mahotas
installation](https://mahotas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html),
including how to find pre-built for several platforms.

## Citation

You can access this information using the `mahotas.citation()` function.

## Development

Development happens on github
([http://github.com/luispedro/mahotas](https://github.com/luispedro/mahotas)).

You can set the `DEBUG` environment variable before compilation to get a
debug version:

    export DEBUG=1
    python setup.py test

You can set it to the value `2` to get extra checks:

    export DEBUG=2
    python setup.py test

Be careful not to use this in production unless you are chasing a bug.
Debug level 2 is very slow as it adds many runtime checks.

The `Makefile` that is shipped with the source of mahotas can be useful
too. `make debug` will create a debug build. `make fast` will create a
non-debug build (you need to `make clean` in between). `make test` will
run the test suite.
